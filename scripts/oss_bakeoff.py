"""Shadow-canary bakeoff: prod (Anthropic) vs. Phase-B OSS candidates
(OpenRouter) coverage-guard parity — config#1659, scope item 5.

Brian's ratified destination for morning-signal (2026-07-03) is an
open-weight model via OpenRouter + the ``openrouter:web_search`` server
tool. The live ``llm`` config/SSM flip is gated (No-Shortcuts) on this
script's evidence: three production incident-guards (``min_web_searches``,
``required_search_topics``, forced-search recovery) were re-keyed to work
off whichever signal a transport actually exposes (see ``claude.py`` and
``search_telemetry.py``), but that re-key needs to be PROVEN safe against
real candidate responses before it governs a live edition — this script is
that proof.

Two candidates run side by side against the same prompt (2026-07-06,
Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index — both tie for #1 among open-weight
models): ``moonshotai/kimi-k2.6`` (the original config#1659 pick, also the
top open-weight model for agentic/tool-use benchmarks) and
``xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro`` (ties Kimi on general intelligence, ~4x cheaper on
completion tokens, 1M vs 256K context). Both are reasoning models and both
carry ``reasoning: {"exclude": true}`` (krepis>=0.11.0,
``ModelSpec.reasoning``) — without it, a reasoning-capable model can spend
its entire output budget on invisible chain-of-thought and return an
empty ``message.content`` even at a generous ``max_tokens`` (reproduced
live 2026-07-06 against Kimi K2.6 with the real production prompt:
``finish_reason="stop"``, ~15K reasoning chars, ~1 char of actual content).

For a given (date, edition) it builds ONE shared prompt + guard
configuration via ``claude.build_episode_request`` (so every side sees the
EXACT same system prompt, user message, and ``required_search_topics`` the
real production run would use), then issues one grounded call per side —
the current production spec (``resolve_llm_spec``, still Anthropic per
Phase A) plus one per candidate — and records a parity comparison to a
JSONL log. NO side is published or TTS'd; this never touches
``episode.py``, the RSS feed, or ``_config.EPISODES_DIR`` (the real
episode's telemetry sinks) — it is a side-channel measurement only.

Run daily (cron/systemd timer, alongside the real production pipeline) for
the ≥2-week bakeoff window. Once a candidate's ``unmet_topics`` matches
prod for ≥2 weeks straight (config#1659's closes-when criterion), the live
``llm`` flip can be scheduled with an operator confident the coverage
guards hold on that candidate.

Each run's JSONL record is written locally (``bakeoff_logs/`` by default)
AND best-effort synced to ``s3://{config[s3_bucket]}/ops/bakeoff/`` for
durability across a box replacement — that prefix is private (2026-07-06:
the bucket's public-read policy was tightened from a bucket-wide wildcard
to exactly ``episodes/*``/``feed.xml``/``artwork.jpg``, so anything else
written here, including this prefix, is authenticated-only by the
policy's own absence).

Usage::

    python scripts/oss_bakeoff.py --date 2026-07-06 --edition am

Exit codes: 0 on a completed comparison (regardless of parity outcome — a
mismatch is exactly what this script exists to surface, not an error);
1 on a setup/run failure (missing OPENROUTER_API_KEY, SSM bootstrap
failure, LLM call failure on any side).
